Description: The GDELT V1 Event data set is over 41 GB now and growing 250 MB 
    a month. The number of source articles has increased over time and unevenly 
    across countries. This package makes it easy to download a subset of that 
    data, then normalize that data to facilitate valid time series analysis.
